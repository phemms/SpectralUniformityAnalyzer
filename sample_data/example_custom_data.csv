# Example custom measurement data for SpectralUniformityAnalyzer
# This demonstrates the required CSV format for loading your own data
# Format: position_x_mm, position_y_mm, wl_400.00nm, wl_402.01nm, ... (wavelengths in nm)
# Units: positions in mm, spectral values as transmission/reflectance (0-1 typical)
